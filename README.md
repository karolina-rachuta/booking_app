# Booking App
This Booking Application allows you to schedule an appointment at a dietitian's office. You can choose between an online or in-person consultation (stationary consultation), select a preferred date and time, and filter available dates based on your chosen start date. Next, simply fill in your details and accept the terms. Finally, you can confirm your booking, go back to make changes, or cancel the appointment as needed.
